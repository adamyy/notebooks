    "\n",
    "- packet switching allows more users to use network\n",
    "    - example: 1 mb/s link, each user takes 100 kb/s when \"active\" and they go active 10% of the time\n",
    "    - circuit-switching: serve 10 users\n",
    "    - packet-switching: with 35 users, probability > 10 active as the same time is less than 0.004\n",
    "- packet switching wins most of the time\n",
    "    - great for bursty data\n",
    "        - enables resource sharing\n",
