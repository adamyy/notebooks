    "# Kendall Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "queues are typically described using Kendall notation of the form: A/S/C/K/D\n",
    "- A: arrival process of the packets (the distribution of the inter-arrival time between packets), can be M (Markovian), D (Deterministic) or G(General)\n",
    "    - Markovian process means that the process follows a Poisson distribution, in which the distribution of the time between successive arrivals follows exponential distribution\n",
    "- S: server process for the packets, can be M, D or G\n",
    "    - a server process of M means that the distribution of the service time is identical for each packet, is independent from one to another, and is exponentially distributed\n",
    "- C: number of servers (or network interfaces)\n",
    "- K: buffer size (number of packets that can be accommodated), if omitted, the buffer is assumed to be infinitely large\n",
    "- D: queueing discipline, which is always FIFO and therefore often omitted from the notation\n",
