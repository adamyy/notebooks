    "# Review Questions from Chapter 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is the Internet?**\n",
    "    - The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is a communication protocol?**\n",
    "    - A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged among communicating entities, as well as actions taken on the message transmission and receipt\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is a local area network (LAN) and what is a wireless LAN (WLAN)?**\n",
    "    - LAN is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, or office building.\n",
    "    - A wireless LAN is a LAN that is interconnected using wireless links\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is an *access network* and what is a *core network*?**\n",
    "    - *Access Network*: the network that physically connects an end system to the first router (also known as the \"edge router\") on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.\n",
    "    - \"Core Network\": The mesh of packet swicthes and links that interconnects the Internet's end systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Network | Core Network\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/Snip20191014_157.png\"/>|<img src=\"../img/Snip20191014_158.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is circuit switching? Explain its advantages and disadvantages.**\n",
    "    - In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path (buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are **reserved** for the duration of the communication session between end systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How is circuit switching implemented?**\n",
    "    - A circuit in a link is implemented with either **frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)** or **time-division multiplexing (TDM)**.\n",
    "        - with **FDM**, the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link, and the link dedicates a frequency band to each connection for the duration of the connection\n",
    "        -  with **TDM**, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots; when the network establishes a connection across a link, the network dedicates one time slot in every frame to this connection\n",
    "\n",
    "FDM|TDM\n",
    "---|---\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/Snip20191014_159.png\"/>|<img src=\"../img/Snip20191014_160.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is meant by \"circuit-like behavior\" of a computer network?**\n",
    "    - guaranteed (constant) performance in transmission rate and delay\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What is meant by resource reservation in a circuit switched network?**\n",
    "    - The dedicated circuits are idle during *silent periods*, when one connection is idle and not actively using the link for transmission, its resources (frequency bands or time slots in the links along the connection's route) cannot be used by other ongoing connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Name some key resources in a circuit switched network.**\n",
    "    - frequency bands in FDM (in the links along the connection's route)\n",
    "    - time slots in TDM (in the links along the connection's route)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is packet switching? Explain its advantages and disadvantages.**\n",
    "    - To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as **packets**\n",
    "    - between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and **packet switches** (routers and link-layer switches)\n",
    "    - packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the *full* transmission rate of the link ($t_{trans}=L/R$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Compare circuit switching with packet switching.**\n",
    "    - Circuit switching can guarantee constant transmission rate (performance), but the fact that it reserves resources for connections even though the reserved resource can be sometimes idle means that the link support less users.\n",
    "    - Packet switching allows more users to use the network because it does not require resources to be reserved for connections. Packet swicthing also allows for bursty data as resources are shared among all connections and it means one connection can leverage more resources when it needs. However, it gives rise to potential excessive congestion that lead to packet delay and loss, which is then needed to be resolved with protocols that provide reliable data transfer and congestion control.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Explain the concept of \"store-and-forward\" in packet switching.**\n",
    "    - The packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **What are Tier-1, Regional ISPs, and Access ISP networks?**\n",
    "    - Access ISP: End systems connect to the Internet via access ISP network. Access ISP can provide either wired or wireless connection to Tier 1 ISP, IXP, or Regional ISP. \n",
    "    - Regional ISP: In a given region, there may exist regional ISP to which all the access networks in the region connect. \n",
    "    - Tier-1: Tier 1 ISP is an ISP that has access to the entire Internet Region solely via its free and reciprocal peering agreements, and it doesn't pay transit fees to anyone to reach any destination in the Internet Regionã€‚\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **What is a broadcast link and what is a point-to-point link?**\n",
    "    - Point-to-point link\n",
    "        - consists of a single sender at one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the link\n",
    "    - Broadcast link\n",
    "        - can have multiple sending and receiving nodes all connected to the same, single, shared broadcast channel\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **What is a router?**\n",
    "    - Router is a type of packet switches, it forward packets toward their destination.\n",
    "    - Routers are typically used in the network core.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **Identify and explain four sources of packet delay in a packet switched network.**\n",
    "    - Processing Delay: the time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet + the time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet + etc.\n",
    "    - Queuing Delay: the packet waits to be transmiitted onto the link, the duration of which depends on the queue intensity\n",
    "    - Transmission Delay: $L/R$, the amount of time required to push all of the packet's bits into the link\n",
    "    - Propagation Delay: the time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to the next router\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **Out of the four sources of packet delays, what are the most  deterministic and what are highly variable?**\n",
    "    - the most determinitsic: processing delay\n",
    "    - highly variable: queuing delay\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **Identify three performance characteristics of end-to-end communication between two host computers.**\n",
    "    - delay, packet loss, throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "21. **Explain the difference between transmission delay and propagation delay in computer networks.**\n",
    "    - transmission delay is the time required to push all of the packet's bits into the link\n",
    "    - propagation delay is the time required for the bit to travel from one router to another\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22. **Explain how queuing delay changes with traffic intensity.**\n",
    "    - when traffic intensity is high, there is a lot of packets arriving at the router and the queue will be more busy, the queuing delay will then be higher\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "23. **Give an outline of a procedure to measure end-to-end delay between a client computer and a server machine.**\n",
    "    - \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "24. **Why are (data) packets lost in a computer network?**\n",
    "    - ???\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "25. **Why are correctly received data packets occasionally dropped by routers?**\n",
    "    - in reality a queue preceding a link has finite capacity, so when a packet arrive to find a full queue, the router will **drop** the packet and the packet will be *lost*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "26. **What better features can an expensive router have compared to a low cost router?**\n",
    "    - it can have a longer packet queue for packet switching, thus reducing the probability of a packet loss\n",
    "    - for a WLAN router, it can implement optional function like PCF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "27. **What are throughput, instantaneous throughput, and average throughput?**\n",
    "    - Throughput: rate at which bits are transferred between sender/receiver\n",
    "    - Instantaneous Throughput: the rate at any instant of time at which receiving host is receiving the message\n",
    "    - Average Throughpt: the average transfer rate at which the receiving host is receiving the message\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "28. **What is bottleneck bandwidth?**\n",
    "    - in a connection made of many links, the bottleneck link is the link on end-end path that constrains the end-end throughput (likely with the smallest throughput)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "29. **Why are network protocols organized in a layered fashion on hosts and routers?**\n",
    "    - to deal with complex systems\n",
    "        - modulation eases maintenance, updating of system, since change of implementation of a layer's service is transparent to the rest of the system\n",
    "        - explicit structure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "30. **Briefly explain the Internet protocol stack**\n",

    "        - application: supporting network applications (software), e.g., FTP, SMTP, HTTP\n",
    "        - transport: process-process data transfer (software), e.g., TCP, UDP\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "32. **What is message encapsulation? Explain its advantages.**\n",
    "    - In general, message encapsulation in network means each layer encapsulate the message from its upper layer with additional header/trailer information for its own purpose.\n",
    "    - The main advantage is the modular design, which allows each layer to implement its own logic without leaking/exposing its own context to other layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
