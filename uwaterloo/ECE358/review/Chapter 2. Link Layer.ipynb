    "10.\t**What is one-dimensional parity checking? Explain its advantage(s) and limitation(s).**\n",
    "    - Also called single-bit parity checking. It adds a single bit to the data to make the number of 1's even in even parity, or odd in odd parity. After the message is received, the number of 1's is examined to check whether if it matches the parity pattern.\n",
    "    - Its advantage is that it has very little overhead, with just one redundant EDC bit.\n",
    "    - Its disadvantage is that it can only detect single bit error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11.\t**What is two-dimensional parity checking? Explain its advantage(s) and limitation(s).**\n",
    "    - In two-dimensional parity checking, the data is organized in a matrix and parity bits are computed for both rows and columns. This method can both detect and correct single-bit error. However, its disadvantage lies in that it requires a lot of redundant EDC bits, leading to more overhead.\n",

    "    - In CRC, a generator $G$ of size $r+1$ is chosen. The CRC bit of $r$ bits is calculated as the remainder of modulo 2 division of $D$ by $G$. CRC method can detect all burst errors less than $r+1$ bits. If $<D',R'>$ received by the receiver gives a non-zero remainder when modolo 2 divided by $G$, then it contains errors.\n",

    "17.\t**Where does frame (packet) collision occur? Why is it important for a transmitters to detect collision?**\n",
    "    - Given a single shared broadcast channel, when there are two or more simultaneous transmission by nodes, collision occurs. When a collision happens, packets or messages may be dropped or not received by the receiver. It is important for a transmitter to detect collision so that it can abort transmission and resend the message if necessary.\n",

    "    - for each node, when a frame arrives, it transmits immediately\n",
    "    - while the node is transmitting, it listen to the channel and detect collisions\n",
    "        - if no collisions are detected during the transmission of frame, it concludes that the frame is succcessfully transmitted and transmit the next frame\n",
    "\n",

    "        - nodes are synchronized\n",
    "        - collisions can be detected by each node\n",
    "    - when a node obtains a fresh frame, it transmits in the next slot\n",
    "        - if there is no collision in the transmission, the node can send new frame in the next time slot\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "25.\t**How does slotted Aloha differ from pure Aloha?**\n",
    "    - slotted Aloha divide up the time into equal size time slots and assume that all nodes are synchronized and only transmit at the slot beginning\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "28.\t**Why does slotted Aloha give you better efficiency?**\n",
    "    - In short, it avoids more collisions by synchronizing the node and restrict transmission to start only at the beginning of each time slot\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "36.\t**Where is the purpose of using the broadcast MAC address?**\n",
    "    - when the sender does not know the MAC address of the receiver, it sends a broadcast ARP query packet containing the receiver's IP address and destination address of the packet is set to FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF\n",
    "    - all nodes in the same LAN will receive the query packet, nodes with unmatching IP address simply drop the packet, nodes with matching IP address replies to the receiver with its MAC address (unicast)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "37.\t**What does the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) do?**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "38.\t**Briefly explain the ARP protocol.**\n",
    "    - every node stores an ARP table that maps an IP address to a MAC address, each row contains the IP address, its matching MAC address, and a TTL (time to live, time after which the address mapping will be forgotten)\n",
    "    - When A wants to send datagram to B, it first look up in its ARP table\n",
    "        - if the MAC address is found, node A sends the datagram with B's MAC and IP address\n",

    "    - assume router R connects the two LAN with MAC address R1 and R2\n",
    "    - assume the sender knows the address R1\n",
    "    - While the IP packet moves from LAN1 to R, the destination MAC address in the frame will be R1, and the source MAC address will be the MAC address of the sender\n",
    "    - after R has received the link-layer frame, it decapsulates the frame and passes the datagram up to IP layer\n",
    "    - R then creates another link-layer frame with receiver's MAC address as destination, and R2 as source address\n",
    "    - R sends the frame to receiver\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "41.\t**Compare the bus topology and the star topology of LANs in terms of installing and managing LANs.**\n",

    "            - if entry found for destination, check if the destination is the same as the source address\n",
    "                - if so, drop the frame\n",
    "                - otherwise, forward the frame on interface indicated by the entry\n",

    "48.\t**What is a Basic Service Set (BSS), an Independent BSS (IBSS), and an Extended (BSS)?**\n",
    "    - **BSS**: the basic building block in a WiFi, consists of one or more wireless stations and one Access Point\n",
    "    - **Independent BSS**: BSS - AP. A group of wireless stations that formed a network to communicate among each other without an AP. This type of network is called adhoc network.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "52.\t**What is the DCF mode of operation of a WiFi network? What is the usefulness of the DCF mode of operation?**\n",
    "    - nodes make their own decision for transmission, and compete for medium access\n",
    "    - there is no need for an AP; if there is an AP, it behaves like a normal node; the AP is typically used to provide connectivity to the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "53.\t**Who performs the PCF/DCF mode switching in a WLAN and how is it done?**\n",

    "        - The sender then proceeds to send the DATA frame\n",
    "        - After received the data, the receiver replies with an ACK frame\n",
    "    - Whether or not handshaking mode is used depends on the size of the DATA frame, if it is larger than dotRTSThreshold, then handshaking is used\n",
    "    - The overhead is the RTS and CTS signal\n",

    "\n",
    "60.\t**Explain the exposed terminal problem.**\n",
    "    - In wireless networking, the exposed terminal problem occurs when a node is prevented from sending packets to other nodes because of co-channel interference with a neighboring transmitter. This leads to loss of opportunity to transmit and loss of bandwidth.\n",
    "    - In an example, say A, B, D are in close proximity and node A, B, C are in close proximity. Node A wants to transfer to node D and node B wants to transfer to node C. In this case, if B transmits a frame to C, it will not collide with the transmission from A to D. However, since B knows someone is transmitting, it will not initiate the transmission because it is unaware of D's location.\n",
    "    - The problem is due to B being exposed to A's transmission.\n",
