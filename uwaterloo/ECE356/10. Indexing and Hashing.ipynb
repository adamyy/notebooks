    "- in most cases the query returns only a small subset of the records in a table -> we would like to *locate these records efficiently*\n",
    "- fundamental file structures have fundamental weaknesses\n",
    "    - **heap file**: insertion is fast but a lookup requires a *scan*\n",
    "    - **sequential file**: supports binary search (logarithmic time) but only on *one search key*, all other queries require a *scan*, and furthermore the use of *overflow blocks* degrades performance\n",

    "- indices boost performance in two ways\n",
    "    1. organize data in ways that benefit specific types of queries\n",
    "    2. usually smaller than the data files they refer to \n",
    "        - the buffer pool manager is more likely to hold them in main memory, which avoids expensive I/O operations\n",

    "### Types of indices\n",
