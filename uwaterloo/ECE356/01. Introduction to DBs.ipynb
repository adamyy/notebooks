    "# Drawbacks of File Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- file systems lead to data **redundancy and inconsistency**\n",
    "    - multiple file formats, duplication of information in different files\n",
    "- file systems **cannot answer queries directly**\n",
    "    - write a new program to carry out each new task\n",
    "    - one data set may be scattered across multiple files\n",
    "- file systems do **not enforce integrity**\n",
    "    - integrity constriants become buried in program code rather than being stated explicitly\n",
    "    - adding new constraints or changing existing ones is cumbersome\n",
    "- updates in a file system are **not always atomic**\n",
    "    - failures may leave data in an inconsistent state with partial updates carried out\n",
    "- file systems offer **limited support for concurrent access** by multiple users\n",
    "    - concurrent access needed for performance\n",
    "    - uncontrolled concurrent accesses can lead to inconsistencies\n",
    "- file systems do not provide sufficient **security**\n",
    "    - difficult to provide access to a specific subset of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "A database management system (DBMS) offers solutions to above problems\n"
