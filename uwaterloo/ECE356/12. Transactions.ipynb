    "- two important issues must be dealt with in transaction processing\n",

    "    - **concurrency**: concurrent execution of multiple transactions\n",

    "- **atomicity**: either all operations of the transaction are properly reflected in the database, or none are\n",
    "    - if 50 dollars is debited from A, then it is deposited in B or credited back to A\n",
    "- **consistency**: execution of a transaction in isolation preserves the consistency of the database (includes integrity constraints, check constraints, and assertions)\n",
    "    - the total balance of A plus B is preserved\n",
    "- **durability**: after a transaction completes successfully (i.e., without aborting and rolling back), the changes it has made to the database persist, even if failures occur\n",
    "    - if 50 dollars is deposited in B, it will not disappear from B\n",
    "- **isolation**: multiple transactions may execute concurrently, each transaction must be unaware of other concurrently executing transactions; intermediate transaction results should be **hidden** from other concurrently executed transactions\n",
