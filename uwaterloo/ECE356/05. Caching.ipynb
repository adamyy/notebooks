    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- databases are fast but have limits\n",
    "    - e.g., MySQL 5.7 can process ~1M small queries per second on commodity hardware\n",
    "- scaling a database across multiple servers is tricky\n",
    "- many workloads are read-dominated, and can be accelerated effectively by caching the results of queries\n",
    "- in-memory caching became"

    "# Memcached\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering\"\n",
    "- cache hit: retrieve data from the cache if found\n",
    "- cache miss: retrieve data from the database and store it in the cache\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- cache management\n",
    "    - data items can be assigned an expiration time by the application\n",
    "    - data items can be updated or deleted explicitly by the application\n",
    "    - eviction is implemented using the least recent used (LRU) policy\n",
    "- partitioning\n",
    "    - the key-value structure stored by the cache can be scaled out across multiple servers by hash-partitioning on the primary key\n",
    "    - a distributed cache can be used with a centralized database\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Look-aside vs Look-through\n",
    "\n",
    "- the L1/L2 cache in a CPU is called a **look-through** cache because in the event of a cache miss, the data fetch from main memory is generated by the cache itself without any additional work from the application program\n",
    "- Memcached is called a **look-aside** cache because the data fetch has to be issued explicitly by the application\n",

    "\n",
    "## API\n",
    "\n",
    "- storage commands\n",
    "    - `set`: adds or overwrites a key-value pair\n",
    "    - `add`: adds but does not overwrite\n",
    "    - `replace`: overwrites but does not add\n",
    "    - `append/prepend`: add data to the value of a key-value pair\n",
    "    - `cas`: check-and-set (or compare-and-swap), replaces a key-value pair but only if no one has updated the data since last read\n",
    "- retrieval commands\n",
    "    - `get`: retrieves a key-value pair\n",
    "    - `gets`: similar to get but returns a numerical \"CAS identifier\" (representing a data version) for use with the cas operation\n",
    "- deletion\n",
    "    - `delete`: removes a key-value pair\n",
    "- counter commands\n",
    "    - `incr/decr`: adds/subtracts an integer to/from the value of a key (must be positive)\n",
    "- statistics\n",
    "    - `stats`: returns the values of various performance counters and settings\n",
    "- flush\n",
    "    - `flush_all`: causes all items in the cache to expire\n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveat\n",
    "\n",
    "- keys must be named consistently throughout the application\n",
    "    - one option is the to use human-readable hierarchical naming scheme\n",
    "- loading of data from the database to the cache is non-transactional, meaning the data items can be outdated by the time they enter the cache\n",
    "    - protect the `SELECT/set` operations with a lock\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Snip20190924_4.png\" width=80%/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- slow queries can lead to **thundering herds**\n",
    "    - similar to stale data issue above, also solvable with locks\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Snip20190924_5.png\" width=80%/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- values can be evicted and the data integrity is affected\n",
    "    - solution: pack values into one key-value pair\n"
