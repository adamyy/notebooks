    "### Nyquist's Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogue signals passing through physical channels may not change arbitrarily fast. The rate at which a signal may change is determined by its bandwidth. A signal of bandwidth $W$ may change at a maximum rate of $2W$. If each change takes one of $M$ different values, then the maximum information rate is $2W\\log_2(M)$ bits/s (without consideration of noise, i.e., we can increase $M$ indefinitely)\n",

    "### Claude Shannon's Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a transmitted power constraint $P$, a bandwidth $W$ and an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with bilateral power spectral density (psd) of $N_0/2$, then the channel capacity is given by $C=W\\log_2(1+{P \\over WN_0})$ bits/s, where $P \\over WN_0$ is the signal-to-noise ratio or SNR\n",
