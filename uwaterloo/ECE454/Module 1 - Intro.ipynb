    "## Goals of Distributed Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supporting resource sharing\n",
    "- Making distribution transparent\n",
    "    - Users should not be aware of the distributed essence of the system\n",
    "    - Achieveing 100% transparency is impossible\n",
    "- Being open\n",
    "- Being scalable\n",
    "    - Increase performance by horziontal scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supporting Resource Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Peripheral devices (e.g., printers, video cameras)\n",
    "- Storage facilities (e.g., file server)\n",
    "- Enterprise data (e.g., contact info, payroll)\n",
    "- Web pages (e.g., web search)\n",
    "- CPUs (e.g., supercomputer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Distribution Transparent\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributed systems, particularly middleware systems, attempt to provide **distribution transparency**, that is to hide the fact that processes and resources are physically distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "|Transparency|Description|\n",
    "|:---|:---|\n",
    "|**Access**|Hide differences in data representation and how a resource is accessed (e.g., copper wire cables vs optical cables)|\n",
    "|**Location**|Hide where a resource is located (e.g., server location)|\n",
    "|**Migration**|Hide that a resource may move to another location (e.g., DNS for dynamic IPs)|\n",
    "|**Relocation**|Hide that a resource may be moved to another location while in use|\n",
    "|**Replication**|Hide that a resource is replicated (e.g., uploading files to S3)|\n",
    "|**Concurrency**|Hide that a resource may be shared by several competitive users (e.g., multiple users sharing a single cloud drive)|\n",
    "|**Failure**|Hide the failure and recovery of a resource (e.g., resume download from a different server when one server fails)|\n",
    "\n",
    "### Being Open\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **open distributed system** offers components that can be easily used by or integrated into other systems, the openness properties:\n",
    "    - Interoperability\n",
    "        - Defining clear interfaces\n",
    "        - Middleware provides a RPC interface for multiple communicating parties\n",
    "    - Composability\n",
    "        - Defining modules that can be reused in multiple components\n",
    "    - Extensibility\n",
    "    - Separation of policy from mechanism\n",
    "        - Configurable parameters for changing a system's behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Being Scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability** is a system's ability to expand along three axes\n",
    "    - Size (e.g., adding users and resources)\n",
    "    - Geography (e.g., users on different continents)\n",
    "    - Administration (e.g., multiple independent admins)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design concepts tend to limit scalability\n",
    "    - Centralized service (e.g., a single server for all users)\n",
    "    - Centralized data (e.g., a single online telephone book)\n",
    "    - Centralized algorithms (e.g., routing based on complete information)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scaling techniques\n",
    "    - Hiding communication latencies, e.g., validating web form at server vs at client\n",
    "    - Replication, e.g., using distributed memory cache to speed up web application\n",
    "    - Partitioning, e.g., original DNS name space was divided into zones\n"
