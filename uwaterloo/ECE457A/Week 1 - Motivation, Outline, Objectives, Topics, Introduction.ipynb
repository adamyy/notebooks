    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are problems that are **Computable** within a reasonable amount of time, for which type of problems we seek algorithms that can deterministically search for optimal solutions in reasonable time\n",
    "    - **Computability** is the ability to solve a **problem** in an effective manner\n",
    "    - Tend to be called as *P* or *Polynomial problems*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are problems that are **well-defined**, in which the **given state** of the problem, the **goal state** of the problem, and the **allowable operators** (or moves) are each **clearly** specified\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional algorithms and programming techniques work well for solving computable well-defined problems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are problems that are hard to compute, which are referred to as NP problems (nondeterministic polynomial time), which is the set of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time\n",
    "    - Vast majority of NP problems whose solutions seem to require exponential time are called NP-complete, meaning that a polynomial-time solution to one can be adapted to solve all the others\n",
    "    - NP-complete problems are fairly common, especially in large scheduling tasks (e.g., traveling-salesman)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hard problems are well-defined and computational hard problems\n",
    "    - NP hard problems (e.g., traveling salesman)\n",
    "    - Action-response planning (e.g., chess playing)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are problems that are ill-defined, that do not have clear goals, solution paths, or expected solution\n",
    "    - An ill-defined problem deals with complex issues and thus cannot easily be described in a concise, complete manner\n",
    "    - Competing factors may suggest several approaches to the problem, requiring careful analysis to determine the best approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional computing techniques require computing tasks to be well-defined, fairly predictable, and computable in reasonable time with serial computers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus adaptation and cooperation in software is required to solve ill-defined, hard problems\n",

    "### Fully observable vs Partially observable\n",
    "\n",
    "An environment is effectively fully observable if the sensors detect all aspects that are relevant to the choice of action; and it might be partially observable because of noisy and inaccurate sensors or because parts of the state are missing from the sensor data\n",

    "\n",
    "In episodic environments, the choice of action in each episode depends on the episode itself, e.g., spotting defective parts on an assembly line\n",

    "\n",
    "In sequential environments, the current decision could affect all future decision, e.g., chess\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Episodic environments are much simpler than sequential environments because the agent does not need to think ahead\n",
